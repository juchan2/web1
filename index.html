    <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가</h2></a>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is
   an information system where documents and other web resources
    are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such
    as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperte
    xt, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the WWW
    are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be ac
    cessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by
    a software application called a web server.</p>
